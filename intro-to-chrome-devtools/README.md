## A brief History of Browser devTools
- View source(cmd + opt + u) is all you got, it's like a snapshot not the real DOM.
- Alert is not that helpful.
- Console.log everywhere.
- Firebug is the [game changer](http://getfirebug.com) back then.
- Modern bowsers all ship with devTools now!
- Try Chrome Canary.
